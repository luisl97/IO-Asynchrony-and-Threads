With argument 10 I got a 0.112s runtime.
With argument 100 I got a 1.103 s runtime.
With argument 1000 I got a 11.006s runtime.

The runtime depends on how many disk reads are done. Since I know that our
simulated disk has a per-access read latency of 10 ms, we can predict the
runtime of sRed by multiplying the number of reads we want by .01s.

10*.01=.1s
100*.01=1s
1000*.01=10s

These numbers somewhat match with the runtime I got before.
