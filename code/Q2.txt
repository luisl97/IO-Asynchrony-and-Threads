In this asynchronous case we can clearly see that the amount of disk reads
that are done do not affect the runtime as much as sRead.c. This is because
in this asynchronous case we are not halting our program in order to wait
for the disk read to complete. Instead we queue the read and the code keeps
running, waiting for interrupt service routine which will activate the
dequeue.
