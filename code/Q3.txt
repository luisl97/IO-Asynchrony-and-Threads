With argument 10 my min runtime was 0.016s and sys time was 0.007s
With argument 100 my min runtime was 0.024s and sys time was 0.013s
With argument 1000 my min runtime was 0.091s and sys time was 0.070s

In this asynchronous case we can see that there is not much runtime wasted like
in sRead.c, but it is running a bit slower than aRead.c . This is clearly
due to how in tRead.c we have to run a lot more code that in aRead.c. In
tRead.c for each read we perform we create a new thread and each thread has
a constant amount of code, which is why we see that the runtime increases
linearly as the number of reads increases.
